    <h1 id="title">PIGGLETS... ASSEMBLE.</h1>

    <div class="__center_it">

      <h2>This is moonpig. A meme-friendly decentrailized crypto coin.</h2>
      <p>1 piglet = 1 piglet</p>
      <h2>Toeknomics</h2>
      <p>50% burned</p>
      <p>15% growth fund</p>
      <p>The Rest for You</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Why Another Coin?</h2>
    <p>To go to the moon!
      We've all been burned before. Scam coins. The rug pull. The liquidity pull. The non-sellable token. We at Moon Pig
      Mission Control wanted something different. Something fun. Something cute.</p>
    <p>So we made moon pig - we sent some tokens to people who made the project happen. And we launched. We burned
      tokens (no. we didn't send any to Vitalik). We started the liquidity pool. Then we renounced ownership so we
      couldn't get up to any shenanigans.</p>

    <h2>What's the growth fund for?</h2>
    <p>To achieve liftoff to go to the moon!</p>
    <p>Many projects have the community pool funds to get the word out. We're being efficient and doing it ourselves.
      Billboards. TikTok. Times Square. Art. Murals. A concert?</p>
    <p>The growth fund allows that to happen. Like we said. We're here to do dope things. As the world is slowly coming
      out of covid. It's time to enjoy life again!</p>
    <p>We'll tell you what we're pigglets.</p>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>Just a few people with a dream and moonpig stuck in the mind. None of us are wealthy. We started MoonPig with
      $2,000. It was a lot. We're all overworked, underappreciated, millenials. We got tired of coin projects that
      pretended to be more than they were. So we're honest. MoonPig is cute. MoonPig is dope. And the pigglets are all
      beautiful.</p>
    <p>MoonPig won't revolutionize the world. MoonPig won't solve the climate crises. But maybe, MoonPig can do some fun
      things.</p>
